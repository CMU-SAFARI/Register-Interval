 * \brief   Interface for register-interval creation algorithm
 *
 * \algorithm	register-interval creation
 * \input	
 *		1. The CFG of application (the nodes are basic blocks)
 *		2. The allowed number of registers in register-intervals
 * \output
 *		1. The reduced CFG of application that its nodes are register-intervals
 *
 * \purpose	The register-interval creation algorithm partitions the control flow graph of an application inot some register-intervals.
 *		Register-intervals have two main characteristic:
 *			1. They have only one entry point.
 *			2. They have a limited number of registers.
 *		These features of register-intervals are used in LTRF paper and we insert a PREFETECH instruction at the beginning of each register-interval.
 *		So during the execution of a register-interval all registers in its working set will be in the register file cache.
